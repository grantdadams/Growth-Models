# Growth-Models
Some code examples of von Bertallanfy growth models in TMB, JAGS, and Stan that I wrote while studying spatially-varying growth of Sheepshead. Stan models used in the final publication are included. For the Stan models, three model structures were compared to account for spatial growth variation. We also initially explored using a truncated likelihood to account for minimum size regulations in the fishery. There are TMB code examples of a von Bertallanfy growth model that accounts for truncated size distributions.
